# ENSO Demo

[El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/enso/) is a quasiperiodic fluctuation in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and atmospheric pressure over the equatorial Pacific Ocean, associated with changes in weather in the tropics and beyond. These oscillations typically occur with a periodicity of about 2-7 years.

In this series of Jupyter notebooks, I will show how principal component analysis (PCA), spectral analysis, and other analytical techniques can provide insights into ENSO variability. These notebooks also demonstrate the [cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/) package for plotting geographic maps, and the [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package for handling `netcdf` data files and easily stacking / unstacking dimensions to switch between 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional views of the same array.
